To save events, register with a username, password and valid email address. 
To edit and delete events, select an event from the radio button on the right. Then click edit or delete. The rest should be fairly intuitive. 

- Users can register with an email address. There is a forgot your username function that sends their username to their registered email
in the event they forget their username. 
- Users can assign color categories to events to distinguish them from one another. 
- Users can save a description to their events. 
- Users can hover over events to see more information in a clean and crisp format.
- Editing events is made very simple by a JQuery popup. 
- A heavy emphasis on CSS makes the website VERY visually appealing. 


The website has a favicon.
